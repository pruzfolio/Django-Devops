  - [ ] Setting up Django for production: `DEBUG = False`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `collectstatic`.
  - [ ] Basic static file handling with WhiteNoise.

- [ ] **Version Control with Git**
  - [ ] Using Git for code versioning.
  - [ ] Setting up a Git repository for a Django project.

- [ ] **Introduction to Containers**
  - [ ] What is Docker, and why use it?
  - [ ] Writing a basic Dockerfile for a Django application.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] **Create a Django To-Do App:**
  - [ ] Version the project with Git.
  - [ ] Containerize the application using Docker.
  - [ ] Deploy locally using `docker-compose`.

### Tools to Learn:

## 2. Intermediate Level: Automating Django Deployments

### Topics:
- [ ] **Building a CI/CD Pipeline**
  - [ ] Using GitHub Actions to automate tests and deployments.
  - [ ] Writing workflows to deploy to Render or PythonAnywhere.

- [ ] **Container Orchestration**
  - [ ] Using `docker-compose` for multi-container applications (Django + PostgreSQL + nginx).
  - [ ] Basics of Kubernetes for scaling containerized apps.

- [ ] **Server Configuration**
  - [ ] Configuring gunicorn as a WSGI server for Django.
  - [ ] Setting up nginx as a reverse proxy.

- [ ] **Basic Cloud Deployments**
  - [ ] Deploying Django on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
  - [ ] Using S3 for static and media files.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] **Build a Django Blog Platform:**
  - [ ] Automate tests using GitHub Actions.
  - [ ] Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
  - [ ] Use Docker for development and production environments.

### Tools to Learn:
- [ ] **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipelines.
- [ ] **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: For managed cloud deployments.
- [ ] **nginx + gunicorn**: For production server configuration.

## 3. Advanced Level: Scaling and Monitoring

### Topics:
- [ ] **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
  - [ ] Using Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to define infrastructure.
  - [ ] Automating the creation of EC2 instances, RDS, and S3.

- [ ] **Load Balancing and Scaling**
  - [ ] Configuring AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer).
  - [ ] Horizontal scaling with Kubernetes (EKS).
  - [ ] Using Docker Swarm as an alternative for container orchestration.

- [ ] **Advanced CI/CD Pipelines**
  - [ ] Using Jenkins or GitLab CI for advanced pipelines.
  - [ ] Implementing blue/green deployments for zero-downtime updates.

- [ ] **Monitoring and Logging**
  - [ ] Setting up application performance monitoring (APM) with tools like New Relic.
  - [ ] Centralized logging using ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

### Hands-On:
- [ ] **Build a Scalable E-Commerce Platform:**
  - [ ] Use Terraform to provision infrastructure on AWS.
  - [ ] Deploy a Kubernetes cluster for container orchestration.
  - [ ] Implement monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.

### Tools to Learn:
- [ ] **Terraform**: For IaC.
- [ ] **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration.
- [ ] **Prometheus/Grafana**: For monitoring.

## 4. Professional Level: Advanced DevOps Practices

### Topics:
- [ ] **Serverless Deployments**
  - [ ] Deploying Django apps on AWS Lambda with Zappa.
  - [ ] Using API Gateway for serverless API hosting.

- [ ] **Advanced Kubernetes**
  - [ ] Implementing autoscaling and self-healing.
  - [ ] Configuring network policies and service meshes (e.g., Istio).

- [ ] **Cost Optimization**
  - [ ] Implementing spot instances and reserved instances on AWS.
  - [ ] Monitoring cloud spending with AWS Cost Explorer.

- [ ] **Security Best Practices**
  - [ ] Securing Django applications with HTTPS (Let's Encrypt).
  - [ ] Managing secrets securely with AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.
  - [ ] Implementing IAM roles for least-privilege access.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] **Build a Real-Time Analytics Dashboard:**
  - [ ] Use serverless architecture for ingesting and processing real-time data.
  - [ ] Deploy the dashboard on Kubernetes.
  - [ ] Secure the application with HTTPS and a proper IAM policy.

### Tools to Learn:
- [ ] **AWS Lambda**: For serverless deployment.
- [ ] **Zappa**: For Django on Lambda.
- [ ] **Istio**: For service meshes in Kubernetes.
